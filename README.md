Hey, I'm 18 and just starting out in web development. This project is super basic—I built it to help me memorize and practice CSS Flexbox terms and properties. It’s nothing fancy, but it was a great way for me to learn how Flexbox works compared to CSS Grid.

What I Learned:

The differences between one-dimensional (Flexbox) and two-dimensional (Grid) layouts.
Key Flexbox properties like flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items.
How to create simple, responsive layouts using Flexbox.
Note:
This project is intentionally simple. It's just a stepping stone as I continue to grow my CSS skills. I’d love to hear any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
